🥗 TiffinTrails

Rescuing Surplus Food, Empowering Communities

TiffinTrails connects local restaurants with eco-conscious customers to rescue surplus meals that would otherwise go to waste. Our platform enables users to order these discounted “rescue meals,” reducing food waste, carbon emissions, and hunger — all while supporting local businesses.

🚀 Our Mission

Every year, millions of tons of food go uneaten while countless people face food insecurity. Restaurants often discard perfectly edible meals due to overproduction or changing demand. TiffinTrails bridges this gap — giving unsold meals a second chance and making sustainability accessible to everyone.

We envision a world where no good food goes to waste and every meal contributes to a healthier planet 🌍.

🧠 How It Works

Discover Local Restaurants – Browse partner restaurants offering surplus meals near you.

Order Rescue Meals – Choose discounted, ready-to-eat surplus meals.

Track Your Impact – See how much waste you’ve helped prevent and meals you’ve rescued.

Support Local Businesses – Every rescue helps small restaurants thrive sustainably.

💡 Impact

Customers: Access affordable meals while reducing your carbon footprint.
Restaurants: Monetize surplus food instead of wasting it.
Communities: Strengthen local connections and fight food insecurity.
Planet: Lower food waste and greenhouse gas emissions.
